Setup for Nvidia:
 It has been long time when I used it last with NCL, so if any problems, write me elmer@fcst24.com

Setup for ncl downloaded from NCAR:
  Older versions may need to make a stub library that would link proper
  system library in. there are problems with older OS
   gcc -shared -o libstub.so libncl_jack.??.so libwrf_user.??.so -lgfortran -lmvec -lomp
 and then load libstub.so instead on libncl_jack.so


it requires vectorization code from glibc, so generally it starts around gcc-8 and glibc 2.22,
 it is quite a pain to install in earlier versions. For debian-ubuntu you can install 
new gcc in parallel and then link with libmvec or whatever provides vectorized math there.
